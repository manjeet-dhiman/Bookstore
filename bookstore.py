"""
This program implements a bookstore clerk system using Python and SQLite. The program allows the clerk to:
1. Add new books to the database
2. Update book information
3. Delete books from the database
4. Search the database using an id to find a specific book.

The program connects to an SQLite database called `ebookstore` and creates a table called `books` with the structure:
- id: integer, primary key
- title: text, book title
- author: text, book author
- qty: integer, quantity of the book in stock

The program presents the user with a menu of options, and performs the corresponding action based on the user's input.
The menu options include:
1. Enter book
2. Update book
3. Delete book
4. Search books
0. Exit

The program implements the database operations using the `sqlite3` module.
